### [GoLang Fundamentals 101: Getting Started with Go](https://medium.com/@bhaumikmaan/golang-fundamentals-101-1cc420f7747a)
This post covers the absolute essentials to kickstart your Go journey.
* **Why Go?** Understand Go's philosophy of simplicity, performance, and concurrency.
* **Environment Setup:** Get started with Go installation and essential CLI commands like `go run`, `go build`, and `go fmt`.
* **Packages & Modules:** Learn how Go organizes code into reusable **packages** and manages dependencies with **Go Modules**.
* **Basic Declarations:** Master defining **variables** (with type inference and zero values) and **functions** (with multiple returns).
* **Arrays & Slices:** Explore fixed-length **arrays** and Go's dynamic, flexible **slices**, including how to append and iterate.

### [GoLang Fundamentals 102: Beyond the Basics ‚Äì Types, Structs, and More](https://medium.com/@bhaumikmaan/golang-fundamentals-102-beyond-the-basics-7f4161f75daf)
This part expands your Go toolkit, enabling more sophisticated data handling and development practices.
* **Custom Types & Receivers:** Define your own custom types and attach methods using **receivers**, bringing behavior to your data.
* **Structs:** Learn to create **structs** for grouping related properties and how to embed them for powerful composition.
* **Maps:** Understand **maps** as Go's versatile key-value data structure, perfect for dynamic collections.
* **File Management:** Interact with the file system using the `os` package to **read from and write to files**.
* **Testing in Go:** Discover Go's built-in, lightweight **testing framework** for ensuring code quality and reliability.
  
Checkout the Implementation here: 
* [Structs](https://github.com/bhaumikmaan/Understanding-GoLang/tree/main/structs)
* [Maps](https://github.com/bhaumikmaan/Understanding-GoLang/tree/main/maps)

### [GoLang Fundamentals 103: Unlocking Go's True Potential](https://medium.com/@bhaumikmaan/golang-advanced-103-deep-dive-into-gos-power-features-2e75788e9e68)
The final installment dives into Go's most powerful and distinctive features, essential for building high-performance, scalable applications.
* **Pointers:** Grasp the concept of **pointers** for direct memory access and understand their role in Go's pass-by-value paradigm, especially with structs.
* **Interfaces:** Explore Go's elegant and **implicit interfaces** for achieving polymorphism and writing flexible, decoupled code.
* **Concurrency (Goroutines & Channels):** Dive into **Goroutines** (lightweight execution units) and **Channels** (for safe communication between them), which form the backbone of Go's powerful concurrency model.
* **HTTP Operations:** Learn how to perform basic HTTP requests and understand the fundamental role of `io.Reader` and `io.Writer` interfaces in handling web data.

Checkout the Implementation here:
* [HTTP Operations & File Management](https://github.com/bhaumikmaan/Understanding-GoLang/tree/main/http)
